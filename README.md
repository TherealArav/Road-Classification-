# Road-Classification-
My first project into the world of deep learning. I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify five classes. The aim of this project was to learn about CNN and their application in the real world. It gave me hands on experience with real world data and working to libraries like TensorFlow and karas.
